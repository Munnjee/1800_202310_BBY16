# Project Title
GIGaNet

## 1. Project Description
Due to the lack of available resources to find assistance during extreme weather events, we are developing a community networking application to help connect people seeking assistance with those in the community willing to fulfill that task. Users are able to post "gigs" that they need assistance with and people in the community can apply to the "gig" listings.
